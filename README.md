# Talisman
Console game made in C++ that is a copy of a popular online/boardgame.


This project was made with the use of DEV C++

All of the .txt files contain all of the events, playable characters, monsters (M_Pow and M_Str)

After starting the game the player will be instruced through out the whole game. Hints and clues will be displayed under the board. The main goal of the game is to walk around the board, figting monsters and exploring random spaces to finally fight and defeat the big bad guy that roams the board spaces.


The game was created as a project to showcase my skills in C++, object oriented programing and use of polymorphism.
